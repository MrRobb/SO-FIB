<h3 class="section">5.11 Erasing Sensitive Data</h3>

<p>Sensitive data, such as cryptographic keys, should be erased from
memory after use, to reduce the risk that a bug will expose it to the
outside world.  However, compiler optimizations may determine that an
erasure operation is &ldquo;unnecessary,&rdquo; and remove it from the generated
code, because no <em>correct</em> program could access the variable or
heap object containing the sensitive data after it&rsquo;s deallocated.
Since erasure is a precaution against bugs, this optimization is
inappropriate.
</p>
<p>The function <code>explicit_bzero</code> erases a block of memory, and
guarantees that the compiler will not remove the erasure as
&ldquo;unnecessary.&rdquo;
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#include &lt;string.h&gt;

extern void encrypt (const char *key, const char *in,
                     char *out, size_t n);
extern void genkey (const char *phrase, char *key);

void encrypt_with_phrase (const char *phrase, const char *in,
                          char *out, size_t n)
{
  char key[16];
  genkey (phrase, key);
  encrypt (key, in, out, n);
  explicit_bzero (key, 16);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In this example, if <code>memset</code>, <code>bzero</code>, or a hand-written
loop had been used, the compiler might remove them as &ldquo;unnecessary.&rdquo;
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> <code>explicit_bzero</code> does not guarantee that
sensitive data is <em>completely</em> erased from the computer&rsquo;s memory.
There may be copies in temporary storage areas, such as registers and
&ldquo;scratch&rdquo; stack space; since these are invisible to the source code,
a library function cannot erase them.
</p>
<p>Also, <code>explicit_bzero</code> only operates on RAM.  If a sensitive data
object never needs to have its address taken other than to call
<code>explicit_bzero</code>, it might be stored entirely in CPU registers
<em>until</em> the call to <code>explicit_bzero</code>.  Then it will be
copied into RAM, the copy will be erased, and the original will remain
intact.  Data in RAM is more likely to be exposed by a bug than data
in registers, so this creates a brief window where the data is at
greater risk of exposure than it would have been if the program didn&rsquo;t
try to erase it at all.
</p>
<p>Declaring sensitive variables as <code>volatile</code> will make both the
above problems <em>worse</em>; a <code>volatile</code> variable will be stored
in memory for its entire lifetime, and the compiler will make
<em>more</em> copies of it than it would otherwise have.  Attempting to
erase a normal variable &ldquo;by hand&rdquo; through a
<code>volatile</code>-qualified pointer doesn&rsquo;t work at all&mdash;because the
variable itself is not <code>volatile</code>, some compilers will ignore the
qualification on the pointer and remove the erasure anyway.
</p>
<p>Having said all that, in most situations, using <code>explicit_bzero</code>
is better than not using it.  At present, the only way to do a more
thorough job is to write the entire sensitive operation in assembly
language.  We anticipate that future compilers will recognize calls to
<code>explicit_bzero</code> and take appropriate steps to erase all the
copies of the affected data, whereever they may be.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-explicit_005fbzero"></a>Function: <em>void</em> <strong>explicit_bzero</strong> <em>(void *<var>block</var>, size_t <var>len</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:

| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe

</p>


<p><code>explicit_bzero</code> writes zero into <var>len</var> bytes of memory
beginning at <var>block</var>, just as <code>bzero</code> would.  The zeroes are
always written, even if the compiler could determine that this is
&ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; because no correct program could read them back.
</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <em>only</em> optimization that <code>explicit_bzero</code>
disables is removal of &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; writes to memory.  The compiler
can perform all the other optimizations that it could for a call to
<code>memset</code>.  For instance, it may replace the function call with
inline memory writes, and it may assume that <var>block</var> cannot be a
null pointer.
</p>
<p><strong>Portability Note:</strong> This function first appeared in OpenBSD 5.5
and has not been standardized.  Other systems may provide the same
functionality under a different name, such as <code>explicit_memset</code>,
<code>memset_s</code>, or <code>SecureZeroMemory</code>.
</p>
<p>The GNU C Library declares this function in <samp>string.h</samp>, but on other
systems it may be in <samp>strings.h</samp> instead.
