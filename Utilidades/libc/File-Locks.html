<h3 class="section">13.15 File Locks</h3>

<a name="index-file-locks"></a>
<a name="index-record-locking"></a>
<p>This section describes record locks that are associated with the process.
There is also a different type of record lock that is associated with the
open file description instead of the process.  See <a href="Open-File-Description-Locks.html#Open-File-Description-Locks">Open File Description Locks</a>.
</p>
<p>The remaining <code>fcntl</code> commands are used to support <em>record
locking</em>, which permits multiple cooperating programs to prevent each
other from simultaneously accessing parts of a file in error-prone
ways.
</p>
<a name="index-exclusive-lock"></a>
<a name="index-write-lock"></a>
<p>An <em>exclusive</em> or <em>write</em> lock gives a process exclusive access
for writing to the specified part of the file.  While a write lock is in
place, no other process can lock that part of the file.
</p>
<a name="index-shared-lock"></a>
<a name="index-read-lock"></a>
<p>A <em>shared</em> or <em>read</em> lock prohibits any other process from
requesting a write lock on the specified part of the file.  However,
other processes can request read locks.
</p>
<p>The <code>read</code> and <code>write</code> functions do not actually check to see
whether there are any locks in place.  If you want to implement a
locking protocol for a file shared by multiple processes, your application
must do explicit <code>fcntl</code> calls to request and clear locks at the
appropriate points.
</p>
<p>Locks are associated with processes.  A process can only have one kind
of lock set for each byte of a given file.  When any file descriptor for
that file is closed by the process, all of the locks that process holds
on that file are released, even if the locks were made using other
descriptors that remain open.  Likewise, locks are released when a
process exits, and are not inherited by child processes created using
<code>fork</code> (see <a href="Creating-a-Process.html#Creating-a-Process">Creating a Process</a>).
</p>
<p>When making a lock, use a <code>struct flock</code> to specify what kind of
lock and where.  This data type and the associated macros for the
<code>fcntl</code> function are declared in the header file <samp>fcntl.h</samp>.
<a name="index-fcntl_002eh-6"></a>
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-struct-flock"></a>Data Type: <strong>struct flock</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This structure is used with the <code>fcntl</code> function to describe a file
lock.  It has these members:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>short int l_type</code></dt>
<dd><p>Specifies the type of the lock; one of <code>F_RDLCK</code>, <code>F_WRLCK</code>, or
<code>F_UNLCK</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>short int l_whence</code></dt>
<dd><p>This corresponds to the <var>whence</var> argument to <code>fseek</code> or
<code>lseek</code>, and specifies what the offset is relative to.  Its value
can be one of <code>SEEK_SET</code>, <code>SEEK_CUR</code>, or <code>SEEK_END</code>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>off_t l_start</code></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the offset of the start of the region to which the lock
applies, and is given in bytes relative to the point specified by the
<code>l_whence</code> member.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>off_t l_len</code></dt>
<dd><p>This specifies the length of the region to be locked.  A value of
<code>0</code> is treated specially; it means the region extends to the end of
the file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>pid_t l_pid</code></dt>
<dd><p>This field is the process ID (see <a href="Process-Creation-Concepts.html#Process-Creation-Concepts">Process Creation Concepts</a>) of the
process holding the lock.  It is filled in by calling <code>fcntl</code> with
the <code>F_GETLK</code> command, but is ignored when making a lock.  If the
conflicting lock is an open file description lock
(see <a href="Open-File-Description-Locks.html#Open-File-Description-Locks">Open File Description Locks</a>), then this field will be set to
<em>-1</em>.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-F_005fGETLK-1"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>F_GETLK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used as the <var>command</var> argument to <code>fcntl</code>, to
specify that it should get information about a lock.  This command
requires a third argument of type <code>struct&nbsp;flock&nbsp;*</code><!-- /@w --> to be passed
to <code>fcntl</code>, so that the form of the call is:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">fcntl (<var>filedes</var>, F_GETLK, <var>lockp</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>If there is a lock already in place that would block the lock described
by the <var>lockp</var> argument, information about that lock overwrites
<code>*<var>lockp</var></code>.  Existing locks are not reported if they are
compatible with making a new lock as specified.  Thus, you should
specify a lock type of <code>F_WRLCK</code> if you want to find out about both
read and write locks, or <code>F_RDLCK</code> if you want to find out about
write locks only.
</p>
<p>There might be more than one lock affecting the region specified by the
<var>lockp</var> argument, but <code>fcntl</code> only returns information about
one of them.  The <code>l_whence</code> member of the <var>lockp</var> structure is
set to <code>SEEK_SET</code> and the <code>l_start</code> and <code>l_len</code> fields
set to identify the locked region.
</p>
<p>If no lock applies, the only change to the <var>lockp</var> structure is to
update the <code>l_type</code> to a value of <code>F_UNLCK</code>.
</p>
<p>The normal return value from <code>fcntl</code> with this command is an
unspecified value other than <em>-1</em>, which is reserved to indicate an
error.  The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for
this command:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EBADF</code></dt>
<dd><p>The <var>filedes</var> argument is invalid.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p>Either the <var>lockp</var> argument doesn&rsquo;t specify valid lock information,
or the file associated with <var>filedes</var> doesn&rsquo;t support locks.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-F_005fSETLK-1"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>F_SETLK</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used as the <var>command</var> argument to <code>fcntl</code>, to
specify that it should set or clear a lock.  This command requires a
third argument of type <code>struct&nbsp;flock&nbsp;*</code><!-- /@w --> to be passed to
<code>fcntl</code>, so that the form of the call is:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">fcntl (<var>filedes</var>, F_SETLK, <var>lockp</var>)
</pre></div>

<p>If the process already has a lock on any part of the region, the old lock
on that part is replaced with the new lock.  You can remove a lock
by specifying a lock type of <code>F_UNLCK</code>.
</p>
<p>If the lock cannot be set, <code>fcntl</code> returns immediately with a value
of <em>-1</em>.  This function does not block while waiting for other processes
to release locks.  If <code>fcntl</code> succeeds, it returns a value other
than <em>-1</em>.
</p>
<p>The following <code>errno</code> error conditions are defined for this
function:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EAGAIN</code></dt>
<dt><code>EACCES</code></dt>
<dd><p>The lock cannot be set because it is blocked by an existing lock on the
file.  Some systems use <code>EAGAIN</code> in this case, and other systems
use <code>EACCES</code>; your program should treat them alike, after
<code>F_SETLK</code>.  (GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd systems always use <code>EAGAIN</code>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EBADF</code></dt>
<dd><p>Either: the <var>filedes</var> argument is invalid; you requested a read lock
but the <var>filedes</var> is not open for read access; or, you requested a
write lock but the <var>filedes</var> is not open for write access.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EINVAL</code></dt>
<dd><p>Either the <var>lockp</var> argument doesn&rsquo;t specify valid lock information,
or the file associated with <var>filedes</var> doesn&rsquo;t support locks.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>ENOLCK</code></dt>
<dd><p>The system has run out of file lock resources; there are already too
many file locks in place.
</p>
<p>Well-designed file systems never report this error, because they have no
limitation on the number of locks.  However, you must still take account
of the possibility of this error, as it could result from network access
to a file system on another machine.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-F_005fSETLKW-1"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>F_SETLKW</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used as the <var>command</var> argument to <code>fcntl</code>, to
specify that it should set or clear a lock.  It is just like the
<code>F_SETLK</code> command, but causes the process to block (or wait)
until the request can be specified.
</p>
<p>This command requires a third argument of type <code>struct flock *</code>, as
for the <code>F_SETLK</code> command.
</p>
<p>The <code>fcntl</code> return values and errors are the same as for the
<code>F_SETLK</code> command, but these additional <code>errno</code> error conditions
are defined for this command:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>EINTR</code></dt>
<dd><p>The function was interrupted by a signal while it was waiting.
See <a href="Interrupted-Primitives.html#Interrupted-Primitives">Interrupted Primitives</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>EDEADLK</code></dt>
<dd><p>The specified region is being locked by another process.  But that
process is waiting to lock a region which the current process has
locked, so waiting for the lock would result in deadlock.  The system
does not guarantee that it will detect all such conditions, but it lets
you know if it notices one.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>


<p>The following macros are defined for use as values for the <code>l_type</code>
member of the <code>flock</code> structure.  The values are integer constants.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>F_RDLCK</code>
<a name="index-F_005fRDLCK"></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used to specify a read (or shared) lock.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>F_WRLCK</code>
<a name="index-F_005fWRLCK"></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used to specify a write (or exclusive) lock.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>F_UNLCK</code>
<a name="index-F_005fUNLCK"></a>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>This macro is used to specify that the region is unlocked.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>As an example of a situation where file locking is useful, consider a
program that can be run simultaneously by several different users, that
logs status information to a common file.  One example of such a program
might be a game that uses a file to keep track of high scores.  Another
example might be a program that records usage or accounting information
for billing purposes.
</p>
<p>Having multiple copies of the program simultaneously writing to the
file could cause the contents of the file to become mixed up.  But
you can prevent this kind of problem by setting a write lock on the
file before actually writing to the file.
</p>
<p>If the program also needs to read the file and wants to make sure that
the contents of the file are in a consistent state, then it can also use
a read lock.  While the read lock is set, no other process can lock
that part of the file for writing.
</p>

<p>Remember that file locks are only an <em>advisory</em> protocol for
controlling access to a file.  There is still potential for access to
the file by programs that don&rsquo;t use the lock protocol.
