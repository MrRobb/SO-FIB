<h3 class="section">12.3 Opening Streams</h3>

<a name="index-opening-a-stream"></a>
<p>Opening a file with the <code>fopen</code> function creates a new stream and
establishes a connection between the stream and a file.  This may
involve creating a new file.
</p>
<a name="index-stdio_002eh-2"></a>
<p>Everything described in this section is declared in the header file
<samp>stdio.h</samp>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-fopen"></a>Function: <em>FILE *</em> <strong>fopen</strong> <em>(const char *<var>filename</var>, const char *<var>opentype</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe heap lock
| AC-Unsafe mem fd lock
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>fopen</code> function opens a stream for I/O to the file
<var>filename</var>, and returns a pointer to the stream.
</p>
<p>The <var>opentype</var> argument is a string that controls how the file is
opened and specifies attributes of the resulting stream.  It must begin
with one of the following sequences of characters:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open an existing file for reading only.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>w</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open the file for writing only.  If the file already exists, it is
truncated to zero length.  Otherwise a new file is created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>a</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open a file for append access; that is, writing at the end of file only.
If the file already exists, its initial contents are unchanged and
output to the stream is appended to the end of the file.
Otherwise, a new, empty file is created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>r+</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open an existing file for both reading and writing.  The initial contents
of the file are unchanged and the initial file position is at the
beginning of the file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>w+</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open a file for both reading and writing.  If the file already exists, it
is truncated to zero length.  Otherwise, a new file is created.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>a+</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Open or create file for both reading and appending.  If the file exists,
its initial contents are unchanged.  Otherwise, a new file is created.
The initial file position for reading is at the beginning of the file,
but output is always appended to the end of the file.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>As you can see, &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; requests a stream that can do both input and
output.  When using such a stream, you must call <code>fflush</code>
(see <a href="Stream-Buffering.html#Stream-Buffering">Stream Buffering</a>) or a file positioning function such as
<code>fseek</code> (see <a href="File-Positioning.html#File-Positioning">File Positioning</a>) when switching from reading
to writing or vice versa.  Otherwise, internal buffers might not be
emptied properly.
</p>
<p>Additional characters may appear after these to specify flags for the
call.  Always put the mode (&lsquo;<samp>r</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>w+</samp>&rsquo;, etc.) first; that is
the only part you are guaranteed will be understood by all systems.
</p>
<p>The GNU C Library defines additional characters for use in <var>opentype</var>:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The file is opened with cancellation in the I/O functions disabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>e</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The underlying file descriptor will be closed if you use any of the
<code>exec&hellip;</code> functions (see <a href="Executing-a-File.html#Executing-a-File">Executing a File</a>).  (This is
equivalent to having set <code>FD_CLOEXEC</code> on that descriptor.
See <a href="Descriptor-Flags.html#Descriptor-Flags">Descriptor Flags</a>.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>m</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The file is opened and accessed using <code>mmap</code>.  This is only
supported with files opened for reading.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>Insist on creating a new file&mdash;if a file <var>filename</var> already
exists, <code>fopen</code> fails rather than opening it.  If you use
&lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; you are guaranteed that you will not clobber an existing
file.  This is equivalent to the <code>O_EXCL</code> option to the
<code>open</code> function (see <a href="Opening-and-Closing-Files.html#Opening-and-Closing-Files">Opening and Closing Files</a>).
</p>
<p>The &lsquo;<samp>x</samp>&rsquo; modifier is part of ISO&nbsp;C11<!-- /@w -->.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The character &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; in <var>opentype</var> has a standard meaning; it
requests a binary stream rather than a text stream.  But this makes no
difference in POSIX systems (including GNU systems).  If both
&lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>b</samp>&rsquo; are specified, they can appear in either order.
See <a href="Binary-Streams.html#Binary-Streams">Binary Streams</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-stream-orientation"></a>
<a name="index-orientation_002c-stream"></a>
<p>If the <var>opentype</var> string contains the sequence
<code>,ccs=<var>STRING</var></code> then <var>STRING</var> is taken as the name of a
coded character set and <code>fopen</code> will mark the stream as
wide-oriented with appropriate conversion functions in place to convert
from and to the character set <var>STRING</var>.  Any other stream
is opened initially unoriented and the orientation is decided with the
first file operation.  If the first operation is a wide character
operation, the stream is not only marked as wide-oriented, also the
conversion functions to convert to the coded character set used for the
current locale are loaded.  This will not change anymore from this point
on even if the locale selected for the <code>LC_CTYPE</code> category is
changed.
</p>
<p>Any other characters in <var>opentype</var> are simply ignored.  They may be
meaningful in other systems.
</p>
<p>If the open fails, <code>fopen</code> returns a null pointer.
</p>
<p>When the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a
32 bit machine this function is in fact <code>fopen64</code> since the LFS
interface replaces transparently the old interface.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>You can have multiple streams (or file descriptors) pointing to the same
file open at the same time.  If you do only input, this works
straightforwardly, but you must be careful if any output streams are
included.  See <a href="Stream_002fDescriptor-Precautions.html#Stream_002fDescriptor-Precautions">Stream/Descriptor Precautions</a>.  This is equally true
whether the streams are in one program (not usual) or in several
programs (which can easily happen).  It may be advantageous to use the
file locking facilities to avoid simultaneous access.  See <a href="File-Locks.html#File-Locks">File Locks</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-fopen64"></a>Function: <em>FILE *</em> <strong>fopen64</strong> <em>(const char *<var>filename</var>, const char *<var>opentype</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe heap lock
| AC-Unsafe mem fd lock
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>fopen</code> but the stream it returns a
pointer for is opened using <code>open64</code>.  Therefore this stream can be
used even on files larger than 2^31 bytes on 32 bit machines.
</p>
<p>Please note that the return type is still <code>FILE *</code>.  There is no
special <code>FILE</code> type for the LFS interface.
</p>
<p>If the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name <code>fopen</code>
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-FOPEN_005fMAX"></a>Macro: <em>int</em> <strong>FOPEN_MAX</strong></dt>
<dd>
<p>The value of this macro is an integer constant expression that
represents the minimum number of streams that the implementation
guarantees can be open simultaneously.  You might be able to open more
than this many streams, but that is not guaranteed.  The value of this
constant is at least eight, which includes the three standard streams
<code>stdin</code>, <code>stdout</code>, and <code>stderr</code>.  In POSIX.1 systems this
value is determined by the <code>OPEN_MAX</code> parameter; see <a href="General-Limits.html#General-Limits">General Limits</a>.  In BSD and GNU, it is controlled by the <code>RLIMIT_NOFILE</code>
resource limit; see <a href="Limits-on-Resources.html#Limits-on-Resources">Limits on Resources</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-freopen"></a>Function: <em>FILE *</em> <strong>freopen</strong> <em>(const char *<var>filename</var>, const char *<var>opentype</var>, FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe corrupt fd
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is like a combination of <code>fclose</code> and <code>fopen</code>.
It first closes the stream referred to by <var>stream</var>, ignoring any
errors that are detected in the process.  (Because errors are ignored,
you should not use <code>freopen</code> on an output stream if you have
actually done any output using the stream.)  Then the file named by
<var>filename</var> is opened with mode <var>opentype</var> as for <code>fopen</code>,
and associated with the same stream object <var>stream</var>.
</p>
<p>If the operation fails, a null pointer is returned; otherwise,
<code>freopen</code> returns <var>stream</var>.  On Linux, <code>freopen</code> may also
fail and set <code>errno</code> to <code>EBUSY</code> when the kernel structure for
the old file descriptor was not initialized completely before <code>freopen</code>
was called.  This can only happen in multi-threaded programs, when two
threads race to allocate the same file descriptor number.  To avoid the
possibility of this race, do not use <code>close</code> to close the underlying
file descriptor for a <code>FILE</code>; either use <code>freopen</code> while the
file is still open, or use <code>open</code> and then <code>dup2</code> to install
the new file descriptor.
</p>
<p><code>freopen</code> has traditionally been used to connect a standard stream
such as <code>stdin</code> with a file of your own choice.  This is useful in
programs in which use of a standard stream for certain purposes is
hard-coded.  In the GNU C Library, you can simply close the standard
streams and open new ones with <code>fopen</code>.  But other systems lack
this ability, so using <code>freopen</code> is more portable.
</p>
<p>When the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a
32 bit machine this function is in fact <code>freopen64</code> since the LFS
interface replaces transparently the old interface.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-freopen64"></a>Function: <em>FILE *</em> <strong>freopen64</strong> <em>(const char *<var>filename</var>, const char *<var>opentype</var>, FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Unsafe corrupt
| AC-Unsafe corrupt fd
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>This function is similar to <code>freopen</code>.  The only difference is that
on 32 bit machine the stream returned is able to read beyond the
2^31 bytes limits imposed by the normal interface.  It should be
noted that the stream pointed to by <var>stream</var> need not be opened
using <code>fopen64</code> or <code>freopen64</code> since its mode is not important
for this function.
</p>
<p>If the sources are compiled with <code>_FILE_OFFSET_BITS == 64</code> on a 32
bits machine this function is available under the name <code>freopen</code>
and so transparently replaces the old interface.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>In some situations it is useful to know whether a given stream is
available for reading or writing.  This information is normally not
available and would have to be remembered separately.  Solaris
introduced a few functions to get this information from the stream
descriptor and these functions are also available in the GNU C Library.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-_005f_005ffreadable"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>__freadable</strong> <em>(FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>__freadable</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was opened to allow reading.  In this case the return value
is nonzero.  For write-only streams the function returns zero.
</p>
<p>This function is declared in <samp>stdio_ext.h</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-_005f_005ffwritable"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>__fwritable</strong> <em>(FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>__fwritable</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was opened to allow writing.  In this case the return value
is nonzero.  For read-only streams the function returns zero.
</p>
<p>This function is declared in <samp>stdio_ext.h</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>For slightly different kinds of problems there are two more functions.
They provide even finer-grained information.
</p>
<dl>
<dt><a name="index-_005f_005ffreading"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>__freading</strong> <em>(FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>__freading</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was last read from or whether it is opened read-only.  In
this case the return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero.
Determining whether a stream opened for reading and writing was last
used for writing allows to draw conclusions about the content about the
buffer, among other things.
</p>
<p>This function is declared in <samp>stdio_ext.h</samp>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt><a name="index-_005f_005ffwriting"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>__fwriting</strong> <em>(FILE *<var>stream</var>)</em></dt>
<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The <code>__fwriting</code> function determines whether the stream
<var>stream</var> was last written to or whether it is opened write-only.  In
this case the return value is nonzero, otherwise it is zero.
</p>
<p>This function is declared in <samp>stdio_ext.h</samp>.
