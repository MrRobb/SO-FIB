<h3 class="section">5.1 Representation of Strings</h3>
<a name="index-string_002c-representation-of"></a>

<p>This section is a quick summary of string concepts for beginning C
programmers.  It describes how strings are represented in C
and some common pitfalls.  If you are already familiar with this
material, you can skip this section.
</p>
<a name="index-string"></a>
<p>A <em>string</em> is a null-terminated array of bytes of type <code>char</code>,
including the terminating null byte.  String-valued
variables are usually declared to be pointers of type <code>char *</code>.
Such variables do not include space for the text of a string; that has
to be stored somewhere else&mdash;in an array variable, a string constant,
or dynamically allocated memory (see <a href="Memory-Allocation.html#Memory-Allocation">Memory Allocation</a>).  It&rsquo;s up to
you to store the address of the chosen memory space into the pointer
variable.  Alternatively you can store a <em>null pointer</em> in the
pointer variable.  The null pointer does not point anywhere, so
attempting to reference the string it points to gets an error.
</p>
<a name="index-multibyte-character"></a>
<a name="index-multibyte-string"></a>
<a name="index-wide-string"></a>
<p>A <em>multibyte character</em> is a sequence of one or more bytes that
represents a single character using the locale&rsquo;s encoding scheme; a
null byte always represents the null character.  A <em>multibyte
string</em> is a string that consists entirely of multibyte
characters.  In contrast, a <em>wide string</em> is a null-terminated
sequence of <code>wchar_t</code> objects.  A wide-string variable is usually
declared to be a pointer of type <code>wchar_t *</code>, by analogy with
string variables and <code>char *</code>.  See <a href="Extended-Char-Intro.html#Extended-Char-Intro">Extended Char Intro</a>.
</p>
<a name="index-null-byte"></a>
<a name="index-null-wide-character"></a>
<p>By convention, the <em>null byte</em>, <code>'\0'</code>,
marks the end of a string and the <em>null wide character</em>,
<code>L'\0'</code>, marks the end of a wide string.  For example, in
testing to see whether the <code>char *</code> variable <var>p</var> points to a
null byte marking the end of a string, you can write
<code>!*<var>p</var></code> or <code>*<var>p</var> == '\0'</code>.
</p>
<p>A null byte is quite different conceptually from a null pointer,
although both are represented by the integer constant <code>0</code>.
</p>
<a name="index-string-literal"></a>
<p>A <em>string literal</em> appears in C program source as a multibyte
string between double-quote characters (&lsquo;<samp>&quot;</samp>&rsquo;).  If the
initial double-quote character is immediately preceded by a capital
&lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; (ell) character (as in <code>L&quot;foo&quot;</code>), it is a wide string
literal.  String literals can also contribute to <em>string
concatenation</em>: <code>&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;</code> is the same as <code>&quot;ab&quot;</code>.
For wide strings one can use either
<code>L&quot;a&quot; L&quot;b&quot;</code> or <code>L&quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot;</code>.  Modification of string literals is
not allowed by the GNU C compiler, because literals are placed in
read-only storage.
</p>
<p>Arrays that are declared <code>const</code> cannot be modified
either.  It&rsquo;s generally good style to declare non-modifiable string
pointers to be of type <code>const char *</code>, since this often allows the
C compiler to detect accidental modifications as well as providing some
amount of documentation about what your program intends to do with the
string.
</p>
<p>The amount of memory allocated for a byte array may extend past the null byte
that marks the end of the string that the array contains.  In this
document, the term <em>allocated size</em> is always used to refer to the
total amount of memory allocated for an array, while the term
<em>length</em> refers to the number of bytes up to (but not including)
the terminating null byte.  Wide strings are similar, except their
sizes and lengths count wide characters, not bytes.
<a name="index-length-of-string"></a>
<a name="index-allocation-size-of-string"></a>
<a name="index-size-of-string"></a>
<a name="index-string-length"></a>
<a name="index-string-allocation"></a>
</p>
<p>A notorious source of program bugs is trying to put more bytes into a
string than fit in its allocated size.  When writing code that extends
strings or moves bytes into a pre-allocated array, you should be
very careful to keep track of the length of the text and make explicit
checks for overflowing the array.  Many of the library functions
<em>do not</em> do this for you!  Remember also that you need to allocate
an extra byte to hold the null byte that marks the end of the
string.
</p>
<a name="index-single_002dbyte-string"></a>
<a name="index-multibyte-string-1"></a>
<p>Originally strings were sequences of bytes where each byte represented a
single character.  This is still true today if the strings are encoded
using a single-byte character encoding.  Things are different if the
strings are encoded using a multibyte encoding (for more information on
encodings see <a href="Extended-Char-Intro.html#Extended-Char-Intro">Extended Char Intro</a>).  There is no difference in
the programming interface for these two kind of strings; the programmer
has to be aware of this and interpret the byte sequences accordingly.
</p>
<p>But since there is no separate interface taking care of these
differences the byte-based string functions are sometimes hard to use.
Since the count parameters of these functions specify bytes a call to
<code>memcpy</code> could cut a multibyte character in the middle and put an
incomplete (and therefore unusable) byte sequence in the target buffer.
</p>
<a name="index-wide-string-1"></a>
<p>To avoid these problems later versions of the ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> standard
introduce a second set of functions which are operating on <em>wide
characters</em> (see <a href="Extended-Char-Intro.html#Extended-Char-Intro">Extended Char Intro</a>).  These functions don&rsquo;t have
the problems the single-byte versions have since every wide character is
a legal, interpretable value.  This does not mean that cutting wide
strings at arbitrary points is without problems.  It normally
is for alphabet-based languages (except for non-normalized text) but
languages based on syllables still have the problem that more than one
wide character is necessary to complete a logical unit.  This is a
higher level problem which the C&nbsp;library<!-- /@w --> functions are not designed
to solve.  But it is at least good that no invalid byte sequences can be
created.  Also, the higher level functions can also much more easily operate
on wide characters than on multibyte characters so that a common strategy
is to use wide characters internally whenever text is more than simply
copied.
</p>
<p>The remaining of this chapter will discuss the functions for handling
wide strings in parallel with the discussion of
strings since there is almost always an exact equivalent
available.
