<h3 class="section">16.1 Socket Concepts</h3>

<a name="index-communication-style-_0028of-a-socket_0029"></a>
<a name="index-style-of-communication-_0028of-a-socket_0029"></a>
<p>When you create a socket, you must specify the style of communication
you want to use and the type of protocol that should implement it.
The <em>communication style</em> of a socket defines the user-level
semantics of sending and receiving data on the socket.  Choosing a
communication style specifies the answers to questions such as these:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <a name="index-packet"></a>
<a name="index-byte-stream"></a>
<a name="index-stream-_0028sockets_0029"></a>
<strong>What are the units of data transmission?</strong>  Some communication
styles regard the data as a sequence of bytes with no larger
structure; others group the bytes into records (which are known in
this context as <em>packets</em>).

</li><li> <a name="index-loss-of-data-on-sockets"></a>
<a name="index-data-loss-on-sockets"></a>
<strong>Can data be lost during normal operation?</strong>  Some communication
styles guarantee that all the data sent arrives in the order it was
sent (barring system or network crashes); other styles occasionally
lose data as a normal part of operation, and may sometimes deliver
packets more than once or in the wrong order.

<p>Designing a program to use unreliable communication styles usually
involves taking precautions to detect lost or misordered packets and
to retransmit data as needed.
</p>
</li><li> <strong>Is communication entirely with one partner?</strong>  Some
communication styles are like a telephone call&mdash;you make a
<em>connection</em> with one remote socket and then exchange data
freely.  Other styles are like mailing letters&mdash;you specify a
destination address for each message you send.
</li></ul>

<a name="index-namespace-_0028of-socket_0029"></a>
<a name="index-domain-_0028of-socket_0029"></a>
<a name="index-socket-namespace"></a>
<a name="index-socket-domain"></a>
<p>You must also choose a <em>namespace</em> for naming the socket.  A socket
name (&ldquo;address&rdquo;) is meaningful only in the context of a particular
namespace.  In fact, even the data type to use for a socket name may
depend on the namespace.  Namespaces are also called &ldquo;domains&rdquo;, but we
avoid that word as it can be confused with other usage of the same
term.  Each namespace has a symbolic name that starts with &lsquo;<samp>PF_</samp>&rsquo;.
A corresponding symbolic name starting with &lsquo;<samp>AF_</samp>&rsquo; designates the
address format for that namespace.
</p>
<a name="index-network-protocol"></a>
<a name="index-protocol-_0028of-socket_0029"></a>
<a name="index-socket-protocol"></a>
<a name="index-protocol-family"></a>
<p>Finally you must choose the <em>protocol</em> to carry out the
communication.  The protocol determines what low-level mechanism is used
to transmit and receive data.  Each protocol is valid for a particular
namespace and communication style; a namespace is sometimes called a
<em>protocol family</em> because of this, which is why the namespace names
start with &lsquo;<samp>PF_</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The rules of a protocol apply to the data passing between two programs,
perhaps on different computers; most of these rules are handled by the
operating system and you need not know about them.  What you do need to
know about protocols is this:
</p>
<ul>
<li> In order to have communication between two sockets, they must specify
the <em>same</em> protocol.

</li><li> Each protocol is meaningful with particular style/namespace
combinations and cannot be used with inappropriate combinations.  For
example, the TCP protocol fits only the byte stream style of
communication and the Internet namespace.

</li><li> For each combination of style and namespace there is a <em>default
protocol</em>, which you can request by specifying 0 as the protocol
number.  And that&rsquo;s what you should normally do&mdash;use the default.
</li></ul>

<p>Throughout the following description at various places
variables/parameters to denote sizes are required.  And here the trouble
starts.  In the first implementations the type of these variables was
simply <code>int</code>.  On most machines at that time an <code>int</code> was 32
bits wide, which created a <em>de facto</em> standard requiring 32-bit
variables.  This is important since references to variables of this type
are passed to the kernel.
</p>
<p>Then the POSIX people came and unified the interface with the words &quot;all
size values are of type <code>size_t</code>&quot;.  On 64-bit machines
<code>size_t</code> is 64 bits wide, so pointers to variables were no longer
possible.
</p>
<p>The Unix98 specification provides a solution by introducing a type
<code>socklen_t</code>.  This type is used in all of the cases that POSIX
changed to use <code>size_t</code>.  The only requirement of this type is that
it be an unsigned type of at least 32 bits.  Therefore, implementations
which require that references to 32-bit variables be passed can be as
happy as implementations which use 64-bit values.
</p>
