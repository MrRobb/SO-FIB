<p>You can use the functions in this section to perform comparisons on the
contents of strings and arrays.  As well as checking for equality, these
functions can also be used as the ordering functions for sorting
operations.  See <a href="Searching-and-Sorting.html#Searching-and-Sorting">Searching and Sorting</a>, for an example of this.
</p>
<p>Unlike most comparison operations in C, the string comparison functions
return a nonzero value if the strings are <em>not</em> equivalent rather
than if they are.  The sign of the value indicates the relative ordering
of the first part of the strings that are not equivalent:  a
negative value indicates that the first string is &ldquo;less&rdquo; than the
second, while a positive value indicates that the first string is
&ldquo;greater&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>The most common use of these functions is to check only for equality.
This is canonically done with an expression like &lsquo;<samp>!&nbsp;strcmp&nbsp;(s1,&nbsp;s2)</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->.
</p>
<p>All of these functions are declared in the header file <samp>string.h</samp>.

<p>The function <code>memcmp</code> compares the <var>size</var> bytes of memory
beginning at <var>a1</var> against the <var>size</var> bytes of memory beginning
at <var>a2</var>.  The value returned has the same sign as the difference
between the first differing pair of bytes (interpreted as <code>unsigned
char</code> objects, then promoted to <code>int</code>).
</p>
<p>If the contents of the two blocks are equal, <code>memcmp</code> returns
<code>0</code>.

<dd>
<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe 
| AS-Safe 
| AC-Safe 
| See <a href="POSIX-Safety-Concepts.html#POSIX-Safety-Concepts">POSIX Safety Concepts</a>.
</p>

<p>The function <code>wmemcmp</code> compares the <var>size</var> wide characters
beginning at <var>a1</var> against the <var>size</var> wide characters beginning
at <var>a2</var>.  The value returned is smaller than or larger than zero
depending on whether the first differing wide character is <var>a1</var> is
smaller or larger than the corresponding wide character in <var>a2</var>.
</p>
<p>If the contents of the two blocks are equal, <code>wmemcmp</code> returns
<code>0</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>On arbitrary arrays, the <code>memcmp</code> function is mostly useful for
testing equality.  It usually isn&rsquo;t meaningful to do byte-wise ordering
comparisons on arrays of things other than bytes.  For example, a
byte-wise comparison on the bytes that make up floating-point numbers
isn&rsquo;t likely to tell you anything about the relationship between the
values of the floating-point numbers.
</p>
<p><code>wmemcmp</code> is really only useful to compare arrays of type
<code>wchar_t</code> since the function looks at <code>sizeof (wchar_t)</code> bytes
at a time and this number of bytes is system dependent.
</p>
<p>You should also be careful about using <code>memcmp</code> to compare objects
that can contain &ldquo;holes&rdquo;, such as the padding inserted into structure
objects to enforce alignment requirements, extra space at the end of
unions, and extra bytes at the ends of strings whose length is less
than their allocated size.  The contents of these &ldquo;holes&rdquo; are
indeterminate and may cause strange behavior when performing byte-wise
comparisons.  For more predictable results, perform an explicit
component-wise comparison.
</p>
<p>For example, given a structure type definition like:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">struct foo
  {
    unsigned char tag;
    union
      {
        double f;
        long i;
        char *p;
      } value;
  };
</pre></div>

<p>you are better off writing a specialized comparison function to compare
<code>struct foo</code> objects instead of comparing them with <code>memcmp</code>.

<p>The <code>strcmp</code> function compares the string <var>s1</var> against

<p>Here are some examples showing the use of <code>strcmp</code> and

character functions).  These examples assume the use of the ASCII
character set.  (If some other character set&mdash;say, EBCDIC&mdash;is used
instead, then the glyphs are associated with different numeric codes,
and the return values and ordering may differ.)

<dt><a name="index-strverscmp"></a>Function: <em>int</em> <strong>strverscmp</strong> <em>(const char *<var>s1</var>, const char *<var>s2</var>)</em></dt>

<p>Preliminary:
| MT-Safe locale
| AS-Safe

</p>

<p>The <code>strverscmp</code> function compares the string <var>s1</var> against
<var>s2</var>, considering them as holding indices/version numbers.  The
return value follows the same conventions as found in the
<code>strcmp</code> function.  In fact, if <var>s1</var> and <var>s2</var> contain no
digits, <code>strverscmp</code> behaves like <code>strcmp</code>
(in the sense that the sign of the result is the same).
</p>
<p>The comparison algorithm which the <code>strverscmp</code> function implements
differs slightly from other version-comparison algorithms.  The
implementation is based on a finite-state machine, whose behavior is
approximated below.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The input strings are each split into sequences of non-digits and
digits.  These sequences can be empty at the beginning and end of the
string.  Digits are determined by the <code>isdigit</code> function and are
thus subject to the current locale.

</li><li> Comparison starts with a (possibly empty) non-digit sequence.  The first
non-equal sequences of non-digits or digits determines the outcome of
the comparison.

</li><li> Corresponding non-digit sequences in both strings are compared
lexicographically if their lengths are equal.  If the lengths differ,
the shorter non-digit sequence is extended with the input string
character immediately following it (which may be the null terminator),
the other sequence is truncated to be of the same (extended) length, and
these two sequences are compared lexicographically.  In the last case,
the sequence comparison determines the result of the function because
the extension character (or some character before it) is necessarily
different from the character at the same offset in the other input
string.

</li><li> For two sequences of digits, the number of leading zeros is counted (which
can be zero).  If the count differs, the string with more leading zeros
in the digit sequence is considered smaller than the other string.

</li><li> If the two sequences of digits have no leading zeros, they are compared
as integers, that is, the string with the longer digit sequence is
deemed larger, and if both sequences are of equal length, they are
compared lexicographically.

</li><li> If both digit sequences start with a zero and have an equal number of
leading zeros, they are compared lexicographically if their lengths are
the same.  If the lengths differ, the shorter sequence is extended with
the following character in its input string, and the other sequence is
truncated to the same length, and both sequences are compared
lexicographically (similar to the non-digit sequence case above).
</li></ul>

<p>The treatment of leading zeros and the tie-breaking extension characters
(which in effect propagate across non-digit/digit sequence boundaries)
differs from other version-comparison algorithms.
